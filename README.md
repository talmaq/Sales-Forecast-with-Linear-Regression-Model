# Sales-Forecast-with-Linear-Regression-Model
Sales Forecast with Linear Regression Model

This project demonstrates how to use a Linear Regression model to forecast monthly sales data. The approach involves transforming time series data, generating lagged features, and using these features to predict future sales.

Project Overview
The aim of this project is to build a sales forecasting model using a Linear Regression approach. By analyzing historical sales data, we create a model that can predict future sales based on past trends and patterns.

Key Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Time series transformation and feature engineering
Model training and evaluation using Linear Regression
Visualization of actual vs. predicted sales
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is train.csv, which contains historical sales data.
Columns:
date: Date of the sales record.
sales: Total sales for that day.
store: Store identifier (if applicable).
item: Item identifier (if applicable).
Note: Make sure your dataset is placed in the root directory of the project with the name train.csv.

Results
The results of the Linear Regression model are plotted to show the actual vs. predicted sales.

Performance metrics like MSE, MAE, and R² are calculated to evaluate the model's accuracy.

Example visualization:


This plot shows how closely the model's predictions match the actual sales data.
